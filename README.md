### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. 
### I am Harman Kibue, a backend engineer mainly interested in Golang(Gin) and python(Django/ Django Rest) and some dev-ops automation(learning by failing).I am based in Nairobi kenya.
### I am more than willing to collaborate in any open source project or any idea that changes the world one line of code at a time.
## I run [The Concurrency Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ke/podcast/the-concurrency-podcast/id1667231096) and also write about golang and how I use it's features and libraries in my day to day software development.Lets link up.
